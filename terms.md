Welcome to **9auth**, a script protection, authentication, and monetization platform designed for Roblox script developers. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of 9auth's services, including its website, Discord bot, dashboard, and any related software or tools ("Service").

9auth provides tools for Roblox script developers to:
- Upload and protect scripts via a web dashboard.
- Manage access keys and whitelisted users.

9auth does **not** directly interact with Roblox’s client, API, or platform.

## 3. Key System & Monetization
- 9auth does **not** provide a built-in payment system. All key sales are handled directly by the script developer.
- Free one-day keys can be offered via ad links; ad revenue is retained by 9auth.
- Keys are non-transferable and may not be shared, resold, or reused without developer permission.

To provide authentication and security, 9auth collects:
- Hardware-based identifiers (non-specific)
- IP addresses
- Discord user IDs
- Script usage and execution metrics

This data is **not sold or shared** with any third party and is used solely for service functionality and abuse prevention. Activity logs are not stored long-term.

## 10. Commercial Use
Use of 9auth for commercial script protection is permitted, as long as scripts do not violate platform rules or include prohibited content (e.g., malware, cheats).

---

## 11. No Warranty
9auth is provided **"as-is"** and **without warranty**. We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability or protection from reverse engineering attempts.

Use at your own risk.
